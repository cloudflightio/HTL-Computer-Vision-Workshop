# Computer Vision Workshop
Train a neural network to classify images â€“ with Raphael and Paul from cloudflight.

## Idea
We want to train a neural network to find out if a smiley is happy or sad with hand-drawn similies.

## Setup
* Setup a Python 3.8 environment - e.g. in PyCharm.
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the console to install tensorflow etc.
* Run `jupyter lab` to start jupyter lab and click the link in the console output to open it in a browser.
* Extract the data.zip containing all training and validation data.
* Run the notebook in the browser and change it as you like.

## Result
We reached an accuracy of 92.5% on out validation set!

The validation set also contained some similies drawn by Raphael and Paul 
in Paint, and also some emojies from the internet - just as a showcase that the 
real word smilies can be different than what you would expect :)

## Thank you!
Thank you so much for all the smilies! We did the workshop twice and have 
291 smilies in our train set now! You are awesome!
